        <h3>About Kimmy</h3>
        <br>
        <img src='assets/kimmy1.png' id='k1'>

        <p id='words'>Kimmy is a very nice young girl who is involved in dance, gymnastics, and her school work. 
          Since an early age Kimmy has been interested in natural sciences, and the greater understanding of the world around her. 
          She's known to work on experiments and read up on famous scientists in her limited free time. 
          She currently lives with her mother Stephanie, grandmother Rachel, two dogs (Bella and Rocky), and probably 
          more than a few too many cats. 
        </p>

        <p>Kimmy isn't the kind of girl who would threaten her uncle either. She knows that if she did he could make some silly website that says she
          "sniffs farts" or some other ridiculous claim. Maybe he would put up silly pictures of her, who knows. She would never ever do that.
        </p>

        <h3>On dancing</h3>
        <br>
        <img src='assets/kimmy3.png' id='k3'>

        <p id='words'>Kimmy is very involved in her dance classes, often spending her free time to practice and continue learning
          new dance moves. She's always very excited to practice and show off all the things she has learned in her dance classes. 

        </p>
        <p id='words'>Even as a young child Kimmy has been performing in dance and ballet recitals. 
          some of her most famous roles include "ladybug" and "tree". While she does find it hard to relate and 
          encapsulate what it is to be a tree or a ladybug, and find a deeper meaning in their lives and why they must dance. 
          Kimmy has truly excelled at bringing these characters to life through dance, so that we may know of their 
          plights and what it truly means to be a ladybug or tree through her use of dance. 

          

          
        </p>

        <p>To quote one parent upon seeing her perform as a tree "I have never known what it means to be a tree, until I watched Kimmy 
          dance, now I will never use another sheet of paper, nor shall I build any structure." </p>

        <p>A review of her performace as ladybug #3 read as such "....that young girl (Kimmy) made me feel like 
          a bug for a moment and helped me escape myself and what it means to be human for a short period of time. I will never forget what 
          I saw today, it will be of a constant comfort to me in my twilight years."</p>

        <h3>On gymnastics</h3>
        
        <img src='assets/kimmy3.png' id='k3'>

        <p id='words'>Kimmy has always been a very talented gymnist, even as she was but a child. Early on in her life she performed such gymnastic 
          feats such as 'rolling', and 'sitting upright on her own'. Though she is older now her skills continue to grow with her now performing on
          the bar, and.........somethign else you do in gymnastics....flips? I dunno. 

        </p>
        <p id='words'>Her mother has always been a supporter of Kimmy's constinuous growth in gymnastics often encouraging her to continue and push herself even harder. 
          As a child her mother's strong words let Kimmy to crawl and eventually walk. Something no gymnist could have mastered at such a young age. 
          From walking Kimmy progressed quickly into running, followed by running into things and falling down. Such gymastic feats were met with stunned 
          gasps, by her aunts and uncles. She even mastered a move that her mother perfected in her youth "falling off playground equipment and breaking her arm". 

          

          
        </p>

        <p>Though this move left Kimmy unable to continue her practice sometime, the critics were stunned with the sheer tenacity and will she had to follow in her mother's footsteps with 
          such a risky move. To her it was worth it; the accolades, fans, trip to Wendy's, and plaster trophy she wore about her arm were nothing compared to the swell of pride she felt to follow in her mother's footsteps. 
          A move that some believe that one day Kimmy's own daughter may perform to continue the tradition. 

        </p>

        <p>Also she totally sniffs farts, and loves it. </p>
